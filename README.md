# Safety Track

A VST3 / AU plugin that automatically switches between two tracks depending on amplitude. It will use the louder of the two tracks unless it exceeds the set threshold, in which case it will switch to the quieter track. This can be used to automatically switch into a safety track recored with less gain.
